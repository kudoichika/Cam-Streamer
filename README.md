# Cam-Streamer
A configurable utility widget video viewer that lets you stream raspberry pi cameras on TCP (HD and realtime). Written entirely in PyQt5 (Python and Qt)

### Features
- Stream almost any camera (if you modify the camera-host server code a little bit)
- GUI provides room to store old configurations (IPv4 and Ports)
- Stream easily without the burden of using something new/writing your own http server that streams to web (I had to do that before)

### Usage Demo
- Coming Soon
